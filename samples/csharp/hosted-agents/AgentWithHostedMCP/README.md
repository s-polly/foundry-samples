# What this sample demonstrates

This sample demonstrates how to use a Hosted Model Context Protocol (MCP) server with a
[Microsoft Agent Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/overview/agent-framework-overview#ai-agents) AI agent and
host it using [Azure AI AgentServer SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/overview/azure/ai.agentserver.agentframework-readme) and
deploy it to Microsoft Foundry using the Azure Developer CLI [ai agent](https://aka.ms/azdaiagent/docs) extension.

## How It Works

### MCP Integration

This sample uses a Hosted Model Context Protocol (MCP) server to provide external tools to the agent. The MCP workflow operates as follows:

1. The agent is configured with a `HostedMcpServerTool` pointing to `https://learn.microsoft.com/api/mcp`
2. Only the `microsoft_docs_search` tool is enabled from the available MCP tools
3. Approval mode is set to `NeverRequire`, allowing automatic tool execution without user confirmation
4. When you ask questions, the Azure OpenAI Responses service automatically invokes the MCP tool to search Microsoft Learn documentation
5. The agent returns answers based on the retrieved Microsoft Learn content

**Note**: In this configuration, the Azure OpenAI Responses service manages tool invocation directly - the Agent Framework does not handle MCP tool calls.

### Agent Hosting

The agent is hosted using the [Azure AI AgentServer SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/overview/azure/ai.agentserver.agentframework-readme),
which provisions a REST API endpoint compatible with the OpenAI Responses protocol. This allows interaction with the agent using OpenAI Responses compatible clients.

### Agent Deployment

The hosted agent can be seamlessly deployed to Microsoft Foundry using the Azure Developer CLI [ai agent](https://aka.ms/azdaiagent/docs) extension.
The extension builds a container image for the agent, deploys it to Azure Container Instances (ACI), and creates a hosted agent version and deployment on Foundry Agent Service.

## Running the Agent Locally

### Prerequisites

Before running this sample, ensure you have:

1. An Azure OpenAI endpoint configured
2. A deployment of a chat model (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`)
3. Azure CLI installed and authenticated (`az login`)
4. .NET 9.0 SDK or later installed

### Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables:

- `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` - Your Azure OpenAI endpoint URL (required)
- `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME` - The deployment name for your chat model (optional, defaults to `gpt-4o-mini`)

**PowerShell:**

```powershell
# Replace with your Azure OpenAI endpoint
$env:AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="https://your-openai-resource.openai.azure.com/"

# Optional, defaults to gpt-4o-mini
$env:AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="gpt-4o-mini"
```

### Running the Sample

To run the agent, execute the following command in your terminal:

```powershell
dotnet run
```

This will start the hosted agent locally on `http://localhost:8080/`.

### Interacting with the Agent

You can interact with the agent using:

- The `run-requests.http` file in this directory to test and prompt the agent
- Any OpenAI Responses compatible client by sending requests to `http://localhost:8080/`

Try asking questions about Microsoft documentation and technologies to see the MCP tool in action.

### Deploying the Agent to Microsoft Foundry

To deploy your agent to Microsoft Foundry, follow the comprehensive deployment guide at https://aka.ms/azdaiagent/docs

## Troubleshooting

### Images built on Apple Silicon or other ARM64 machines do not work on our service

We **recommend using `azd` cloud build**, which always builds images with the correct architecture.

If you choose to **build locally**, and your machine is **not `linux/amd64`** (for example, an Apple Silicon Mac), the image will **not be compatible with our service**, causing runtime failures.

**Fix for local builds**

Add this line at the top of your `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
FROM --platform=linux/amd64 python:3.12-slim
```

This forces the image to be built for the required `amd64` architecture.
